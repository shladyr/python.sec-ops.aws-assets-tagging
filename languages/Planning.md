# Project Planning for Automatic AWS Assets Tagging Solution

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create an automatic AWS assets tagging solution to meet SOC-2 compliance requirements. The solution will be implemented as an AWS Lambda function that tags AWS resources across all data centers in a specified AWS account. The metadata will be stored in DynamoDB, and any errors will trigger alerts to AWS CloudWatch and SNS.

## Project Timeline
- **Week 1:**
  - Requirements gathering and analysis.
  - Design of the solution architecture.
- **Week 2:**
  - Development of the script in Python, Rust, Go, and TypeScript.
  - Implementation of unit tests for each language.
- **Week 3:**
  - Integration with AWS services (DynamoDB, SNS, CloudWatch).
  - Implementation of error handling and logging.
- **Week 4:**
  - Deployment of the Lambda function.
  - Testing and validation.
  - Documentation preparation.
- **Week 5:**
  - Review and feedback.
  - Final deployment and monitoring setup.

## Project Milestones
- Completion of the initial script in Python.
- Successful unit testing in all four languages.
- Deployment of the AWS Lambda function.
- Validation against SOC-2 compliance requirements.
- Final documentation and handover.
