# Technical Requirements for AWS Asset Tagging Script for SOC-2 Compliance

## 2.1 Functional Requirements
- The script must tag all AWS assets (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.) across all Data Centers in the specified AWS Account.
- Tagging should follow the predefined schema based on SOC-2 requirements.
- The script should interact with AWS services using Boto3.
- Store metadata, user/group information, and tag values in DynamoDB tables.
- Implement idempotency to avoid duplicate tagging.
- Send alerts to AWS CloudWatch in case of errors.

## 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Ensure secure access to AWS resources using IAM roles and policies.
- **Performance:** The script should efficiently handle large-scale environments with thousands of resources.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the script handles failures gracefully and retries operations when necessary.
- **Scalability:** The solution should scale to support additional AWS resources in the future.
- **Compliance:** Meet SOC-2 compliance requirements.

## 2.3 Environmental Requirements
- **Python Version:** 3.12
- **AWS Services:** Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, IAM, S3, EC2, RDS, etc.
- **Tools:** Boto3, Pytest, Flake8, AWS CLI, Terraform (for infrastructure as code, if needed)

## 2.4 Constraints
- The script should run within the execution limits of AWS Lambda (e.g., memory and execution time).
- Ensure DynamoDB is configured to handle the read/write capacity needed for metadata storage.
