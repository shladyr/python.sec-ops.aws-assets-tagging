# Technical Specification for AWS Asset Tagging Script for SOC-2 Compliance

## 3.1 Script Structure
- **Main Module:** Entry point for the Lambda function, handling initialization and configuration.
- **AWS Interaction Module:** Contains functions to interact with various AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.).
- **Tagging Logic Module:** Implements the logic for tagging AWS resources based on SOC-2 requirements.
- **DynamoDB Interaction Module:** Handles CRUD operations for storing and retrieving metadata.
- **Error Handling Module:** Captures and logs errors, sending alerts to CloudWatch.
- **Utilities Module:** Common utility functions (e.g., configuration loading, logging setup).

## 3.2 Database Design
- **DynamoDB Tables:**
  - **TagsMetadata:** Store resource IDs, tag values, timestamps, and user/group information.
  - **TagHistory:** Maintain historical records of tags applied to resources.
  - **UserActions:** Track user actions related to tagging operations for auditing purposes.

## 3.3 Configuration Management
- Use environment variables to manage configuration parameters (e.g., AWS Account ID, tag schema).
- Store sensitive data (e.g., credentials, access keys) securely using AWS Secrets Manager.

## 3.4 Error Handling and Logging
- Implement try-except blocks to handle exceptions during AWS operations.
- Log all actions and errors to CloudWatch Logs.
- Configure CloudWatch Alarms to trigger alerts for critical errors.

## 3.5 Security Considerations
- Use IAM roles with the least privilege required for the script to function.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Validate all inputs to the script to prevent injection attacks.

## 3.6 Testing
- Write unit tests for each module using Pytest.
- Include integration tests to validate interactions with AWS services.
- Ensure code quality using Flake8 for linting and PEP 8 compliance.

## 3.7 Deployment
- Package the script as a Lambda function and deploy it using AWS CLI or Terraform.
- Create a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
