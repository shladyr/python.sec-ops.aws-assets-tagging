# Technical Specification for Automatic AWS Assets Tagging Solution

## Overview
This document provides a detailed technical specification for the implementation of the AWS assets tagging solution. The script will run as an AWS Lambda function and interact with DynamoDB, SNS, and CloudWatch services to ensure SOC-2 compliance.

## Architecture
- **Lambda Function:** The core script that handles the tagging of AWS resources and interacts with DynamoDB, SNS, and CloudWatch.
- **DynamoDB:** Stores metadata related to tagged AWS resources.
- **SNS:** Sends alerts in case of errors during the tagging process.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors and logs operations for auditing and error tracking.

## AWS Services and Resources
- **EC2 Client:** Used to create tags on AWS resources.
- **DynamoDB Client:** Used to store and retrieve metadata.
- **SNS Client:** Used to publish alerts to a specified SNS topic.
- **CloudWatch Client:** Used to send custom metrics and log data.

## Data Flow
1. The Lambda function is triggered by an event containing the resource ID and user information.
2. The script tags the specified AWS resource using the EC2 client.
3. Metadata, including resource ID, tags, and user information, is stored in DynamoDB.
4. If an error occurs, an alert is sent to SNS and CloudWatch for monitoring and notification.

## Error Handling
- Errors during the tagging process are caught and logged.
- Alerts are sent to SNS and CloudWatch when errors are encountered.

## Security
- AWS IAM roles are configured to ensure least privilege access to resources.
- Sensitive data such as AWS credentials are handled securely using environment variables.

## Configuration Management
- Configuration parameters such as table names, SNS topic ARN, and tag values are managed through environment variables.

## Logging and Monitoring
- Logging is implemented using built-in logging mechanisms provided by the AWS SDK.
- Monitoring is set up through CloudWatch to track the success and failure of operations.

## Testing
- Unit tests cover tagging, updating DynamoDB, and sending alerts.
- Integration tests ensure correct interaction with AWS services.
- Security tests validate compliance with SOC-2 requirements.
